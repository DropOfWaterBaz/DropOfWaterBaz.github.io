            <p class="result-intro">INFJs or Advocates are idealists who take tangible steps to make their ideals into
                reality. The rarest personality type of them all, they are deeply thoughtful and have great
                introspection. They want to do what's right and believe in equality and karma.

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Depth</u>: Advocates don't take others at face value. They understand that people have certain motives
            and needs that they may not actively portray to others and can pick up on what these might be.</p>
        <p>- <u>Conviction</u>: INFJs hold their principles very dear to them. Their principles are their guidelines to
            life. When speaking about them, INFJs can be very persuasive as their passion is evident through the way
            they speak.</p>
        <p>- <u>Decisiveness</u>: The aforementioned conviction allows INFJs to be more decisive. Will their principles
            leading them, they have confidence that the decision they make will be the right one.</p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Headstrong</u>: Advocates are very passionate about their beliefs, however they tend to dismiss those
            that don't agree with their ideas. INFJs can benefit from hearing out the ideas of others to broaden their
            views.</p>
        <p>- <u>Emotionally Private</u>: Although they feel strongly about their personal beliefs, they can be deeply
            private about their emotions. They feel worried about the possibility of burdening others with their issues.
            This means they don't ask for help and in turn, don't receive it. </p>
        <p>- <u>Perfectionism</u>: Both a blessing and a curse. It leads INFJs to sometimes great success, but as a
            result they are hugely prone to working to the point of exhaustion.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Advocates are non-materialistic - they would rather work in a field that aligns with their values than in a
            career where they earn a lot of money. They are humanists that work in pursuit of their ideals, of making
            the world a better place.</p>
        <p>Depending on their specific values, a career in law, environmentalism or psychology would suit INFJs. Along
            as they can better the world in a way they like and in a way they know how.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Relationships are important to advocates. They crave sincerity as they are reluctant to be open with their
            emotions to new people. They don't like to have friendships that are only there out of convenience, and so
            can tend to just make small talk to those they are not close to. </p>
