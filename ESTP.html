            <p class="result-intro"> ESTPs or Entrepreneurs love to be the centre of attention. They are the kind of
                people to raise their hand when asked "Are there any volunteers in the audience?". Rather than talking
                about doing something, they prefer just to go and do it. They like to be in the middle of the action.
                However, this could land them in a spot of trouble
            </p>

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Boldness</u>: Entrepreneurs are not scared of the unknown. They like to take on new challenges and risks
            in the pursuit of adventure and discovery.</p>
        <p>- <u>Practicality</u>: ESTPs just do. They like to turn their ideas in to tangible, physical things. They
            don't care for meaningless conversation, preferring to have discussions in which they can put the topic into
            action.
        </p>
        <p>- <u>Directness</u>: ESTPs are straight-forward. They don't dance around an issue and spare those around them
            mental gymnastics. They are clear communicators. </p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Insensitive</u>: Being direct with people is a double-edged sword. On one hand, entrepreneurs get down
            to brass tacks when needs be, but the issue with this is that they are not so mindful how they say things.
            They also struggle to express their own feelings.</p>
        <p>- <u>Danger</u>: The chances that entrepreneurs take can often land them in risky situations. They like to
            explore new things without doing their research or having substantial knowledge beforehand.</p>
        <p>- <u>The Bigger Picture</u>: ESTPs are good problem solvers and like to dive head-first into problems.
            However if working on multiple, related issues (like on a project) they may lose sight of the overall goal
            and the solutions they provide may not integrate well together.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>ESTPs enjoy solving problems using logic and rationale. As the title "Entrepreneur" suggests, they like to be
            the boss of their own work. This is not to say that they don't work well in teams, just so long as they are
            the one in charge. They are very driven people like many self-employed professionals, they are no stranger
            to taking risks, big or small, to further their career.</p>
        <p>ESTPs love action and this is matched by their energy. A practical or action-packed profession would suit
            ESTPs - such as a firefighter, chef or carpenter.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, ESTPs are doers. Although not opposed to them, they don't tend to develop friendships
            over philisophical discussion around a table. Their relationships are more likely to form whilst doing
            activities with others like hiking or building something. This attracts similar people, who want to do
            rather than think about what can be done.</p>
