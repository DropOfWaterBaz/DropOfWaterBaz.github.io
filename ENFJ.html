          ENFJs or Protagonists are passionate and charismatic people. They have
          strong leadership skills that they use in conjunction with enthusiasm.
          They are not afraid of speaking out for what they believe needs to be
          said. They have a fantastic ability to articulate themselves eloquently and clear communication comes naturally to them.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
      </h2>
      <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
      <p>
        - <u>Selflessness</u>: Protagonists are generous people who like to
        contribute to the community around them. They are warm and caring. Those around them know that their generosity doesn't spur from a secret motive but it's just what they like to do and therefore they are well-liked by their peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Peacekeeper</u>: Using their strong leadership qualities, they can
        diffuse conflict with powerful persuasion and good communication. They use their charisma to make light of serious situation and promote harmony amongst groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Reliabilty</u>: ENFJs are extremely reliable because they hate the thought
        of letting someone else down. They can always be counted on to follow up on plans and do what needs to be done.
      </p>

      <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
      <p>
        - <u>Decisiveness</u>: A tough decision can leave protagonists feeling
        paralysed, overthinking the consequences of either outcome of their
        choice. They want the outcome of their choice to please everyone involved, which is a very rare occurrence. Therefore, the bigger the decision, the more difficult they find it to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Self-Esteem</u>: ENFJs hold themselves to a high standard, and their self-esteem is majorly dependent on whether or not they reach
        these standards. These standards being so high often results in the inability to meet them, resulting in the protagonist's self-esteem to take a substantial blow.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Sensitivity</u>: ENFJs accept criticism as it can be used to
        improve themselves and those around them, but they may take it too
        seriously. The main reason they struggle with this is that they want to please others and once again, the thought of letting someone down is a scary one to say the least. They can think too much about these critique and upset themselves
        by doing so.  
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 5%">
        <b>Careers</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Protagonists are fantastic at rallying people together to make a
        cooperative effort as a team. They can delegate, supervise and steer
        others in the right direction. They keep harmony amongst the group they
        are in. They are natural-born leaders and their peacekeeping abilities means they do well in jobs where they work with others in an authoritative capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        ENFJs are certainly suited to a leadership role in a managerial,
        administrative or political position.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 5%">
        <b>Relationships</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        ENFJs are very active in their relationships, putting in effort to
        maintaining their connections with those who matter most to them. They
        see their relationships as hugely important. They are sincere and are
        genuinely interested in their friends feelings and aspirations.
      </p>
