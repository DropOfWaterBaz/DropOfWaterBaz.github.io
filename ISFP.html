            <p class="result-intro">ISFPs or Adventurers tend to be comfortable in their own skin. They like to push the
                limits of of what's conventionally socially acceptable. Despite challenging traditional views, they
                still are introverts and like to keep to themselves. Those who do get to be close with adventurers know
                them as warm and friendly.</p>

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Compassion</u>: Adventurers have a good sense of empathy. They relate well to others emotionally, which
            makes the amicable and are rarely the reason for conflict.</p>
        <p>- <u>Persuasion</u>: ISFPs ability to relate ot others makes it easier for them to speak heart-to-heart with
            others. </p>
        <p>- <u>Artistic</u>: Challengers of social norms, ISFPs like to stand out and do so via artistic expression.
            They can convey their creativity well through visual and musical means.</p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Impulsiveness</u>: ISFPs can often struggle to stick to plan. This can result in them being seen as
            unreliable and can put a strain on their platonic and romantic relationships. It also can cause personal
            issues such as poor financial planning and time management.</p>
        <p>- <u>Self-Esteem</u>: Adventurers are very artistic people, however art is subjective and it's easy to fall
            under self-criticism over something that's not very quantifiable. You can't give a painting a percentage -
            one person may love it and another may hate it. If an adventurer is self-critical or receive negative
            feedback from others, this can have a detrimental effect on their self-esteem.</p>
        <p>- <u>Stress Management</u>: ISFPs certainly live in the present. Consequentially, they can find it difficult
            to step back when there's a lot going on and manage difficult situations successfully. They can be prone to
            avoiding these stress-inducing situations altogether, leading to potential problems further down the road.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Adventurers aren't the type of people to be money hungry. They afe driven by what they feel they need most:
            the liberty to allow their creativity to flourish. They love to experiment and in doing so, can set trends.
            They definitely don't want to settle for a repetitive 9-to-5 job.</p>
        <p>ISFPs would work well in freelance or consultant position in an industry that they love -be it fashion,
            interior design or music event management.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Adventurers make great friends. They are easy-going and don't mind just going with the flow. As long as
            someone doesn't take things to seriously and are sympathetic, they could make great friends. As the title
            suggests, adventurers want to explore the world and do things, they have no time for idle conversation.
            Although laid back, are passionate about the things they love and therefore handle criticism in this regard
            poorly. </p>
