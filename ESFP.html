            <p class="result-intro"> ESFPs or Entertainers are spontaneous people who get easily excited and want to
                share this feeling with those around them. They love to put on a show for others and are very social
                people. They find pleasure in the smallest things in life.

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Showmanship</u>: Loving the spotlight, ESFPs will impress and entertain others using a strong creativity
            and enthusiasm. Every opportunity is one to amuse and engage others and have a bit of fun.</p>
        <p>- <u>Social Skills</u>: Entertainers can talk about anything to anybody. They are extremely talkative and
            much of their satisfaction in life comes from the interactions and time spent with others. </p>
        <p>- <u>Daring</u>: ESFPs are willing to take risks and have no problem pushing the boundaries of their comfort
            zone. They are bold and want to try everything once.</p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Avoid Conflict</u>: ESFPs are very non-confrontational and hate conflict. They will try to get out of
            combative situations which could have future repercussions if problems aren't tackled before they get out of
            hand.</p>
        <p>- <u>Emotionally Sensitive</u>: Part of the reason entertainers avoid conflict is that they can take any
            resulting criticisms to heart. They can react badly to negative feedback. This can result in their social
            circle avoiding constructive criticisms, meaning that the weaknesses don't get addressed or resolved.</p>
        <p>- <u>Long-Term Planning</u>: Entertainers very much live for the moment, which although can be seen as a
            positive as they tend to worry less about the future, can mean that they don't think <i>enough</i> about the
            future. They struggle to properly plan steps to achieve their goals.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>ESFPs love to engage with people, whether they be known colleagues, customers or strangers. They use their
            social skills to their advantage by forming relationships with those who have authority over them as well as
            any professional clients. </p>
        <p>Due to their vibrant and chirpy personalities, entertainers would be great in a career in the hospitality
            sector. They are positive and friendly, which is important in a career such as nursing or a primary school
            teacher. They are also suited to more creative fields like the music or fashion industry. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Entertainers find it difficult to keep their thoughts to themselves. They are enthusiastic, high-energy
            individuals and people who can handle and even match their lively nature are the best people for them to be
            friends or romantic partners with. They find it relatively easy to make new friends because they love to do
            so.</p>
