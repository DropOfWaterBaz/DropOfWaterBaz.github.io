            <p class="result-intro">ISTPs or Virtuosos are unique people. They don't need much external motivation to
                pursuit their goals, their own drive is enough. They use their senses to explore ideas and the world
                around them. They like to be in the thick of it, ready to do the dirty work of their latest projects.
                They like to dissect things like clocks to see how the inner machinations work. They like when others
                take interest in their work and are always happy to help others. Virtuosos, although friendly, are quite
                private which is why they are often considered to be rather enigmatic. They are fair and treat others
                the way they want to be treated themselves.

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Creativity:</u> Because the way that they like to pull things apart and put them back together again, virtuosos
            have a unique way of thinking. They tend to have excellent spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills with
            which they can use in a wide range of real-life situations.</p>
        <p>- <u>Energetic</u>: ISTPs require a lot of energy for their projects and this translates to their social life
            too. They are enthusiastic about most ideas, letting others make suggestions and simply going with the flow.
        </p>
        <p>- <u>Crisis Handling</u>: ISTPs have so much hands-on experience across a wide variety of aspects of life
            that they are almost always prepared to handle an issue should it arise. They don't shy away from a little
            bit of risk when necessary.</p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Boredom</u>: One of the reasons that virtuosos are always working at something is that they get bored
            easily. They are great at figuring out things with little information but may lose focus if something lasts
            for too long.</p>
        <p>- <u>Risk</u>: Not afraid of risk-taking and trying new things, ISTPs get themselves into a wide variety of
            situations. Although risk-taking can come with a big pay-out, it can also result in disaster. </p>
        <p>- <u>Commitment</u>: Because they get bored easily, ISTPs can worry about making a commitment in case they
            lose interest halfway through. They like to take things one day at a time and worry about getting trapped
            into having to do something.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Virtuosos love to know the ins-and-outs, unseen functions and the gears and cogs that make something work.
            Their brilliant spatial reasoning skills allows them to work in fields that simply wouldn't suit others at
            all. However, virtuosos themselves don't suit all occupations. They want to see their work in action, and
            for example something like theoretical physics doesn't intrigue them all too much.</p>
        <p>For this reason, a career as an engineer, mechanic or carpenter to name a few would be well suited to ISTPs.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Virtuosos have such a wide range of experience that it's easy for them to relate to others and be relatable.
            Although easy-going, virtuosos have problems with commitment, which can be a major issue in both friendships
            and romantic relationships. Saying no to such commitments may make others feel unwanted. They don't like to
            be restricted to plans. Being quite private about personal matters, there are few that truly get an insight
            to an ISTP. They like to enjoy friendly competition with their peers.</p>
