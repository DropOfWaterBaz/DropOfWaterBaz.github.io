            <p class="result-intro"> INTJs, also known as Architects, are rational people who analyse everything around
                them. They question authority and for that reason they have no problem "bending" the rules. They enjoy
                new ideas but they mostly care about whether or not they can actually come to fruition.

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Independence</u>: Architects are self-motivated people who like to do things their own way. Rules and
            and restrictions to doing things in a conventional way are seen as a hindrance by them. </p>
        <p>- <u>Thorough</u>: INTJs do their research before making a decision and make sure they are well-informed.
            They don't rely on hunches or "gut feelings", their opinions are backed up by their research and acts as a
            reassurance for themselves.</p>
        <p>- <u>Determination</u>: INTJs are driven by the pursuit of their goals. They are dedicated to their ambitions
            and the honing o their skills. Very few things will stop them from trying to achieve their dreams. </p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Contrary:</u> INTJs do <b>NOT</b> like being told what to do without a sound reason. They can be quite
            combative and may waste time needlessly arguing against any limitations placed on them.</p>
        <p>- <u>Emotional handling</u>: Architects are known to see the world from a logical and rational standpoint.
            This results in them being uninterested in or impatient with emotional matters. This can act as a blockade
            to their own growth.</p>
        <p>- <u>Perfectionism</u>: Architects are very thorough when it comes to their work. Although this could be
            considered a strength, they can be prone to over-critiquing themselves and others. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Architects want to have a meaningful career where they overcome important issues. As a result, they can often
            find themselves unhappy at the beginning of their professional careers as they are in low-level positions,
            given trivial tasks. </p>
        <p> INTJs often prefer to work by themselves rather than in a team. It can give them the most creative freedom
            without limitations from supervisors or interruptions from teammates.They may like to remain low-key whilst
            also doing influential work. A career as project managers, architects (as there name suggests) or even a
            software developer.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>INTJs are quick-witted and cynical, which isn't necessarily the kind of friend everyone wants. However, INTJs
            don't mind this as they don't want to be friends with everyone. They enjoy the company of people who really
            get them. They like to be around someone who can match their high-energy brains. They may however struggle
            to resolve emotional conflict.</p>
