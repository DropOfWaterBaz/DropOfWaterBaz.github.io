            <p class="result-intro">INTPs or Logicians are curious and have a very creative imagination. They tend to
                lose themselves in their daydreams and get tired easily from socialising. They are high-energy
                introverts and connect well with those who match their mental energy.

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Objectivity</u>: Logicians primary goal is the truth. They look deeper into things and want to find out
                about any underlying realities. This means that they are a good control and are very honest.</p>
        <p>- <u>Interesting</u>: INTPs have a large foundation of knowledge and can make great conversation about wide
            variety of interesting topics. </p>
        <p>- <u>Open-Mindedness</u>: In search of the truth, INTPs are accepting of different ideas, insights and methods
            as long as they are back-up by good reasoning.</p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>- <u>Social Unawareness</u>: As they let their minds wander so often, INTPs can also let this happen when in
            social situations. This can leave the people with them feeling ignored and unheard.</p>
        <p>- <u>Perfectionism</u>: Logicians spend a lot of time about what could be better. This can apply a lot to
            their personal ideals but also to their work, which can lead to them finding themselves frustrated.</p>
        <p>- <u>Impatience</u>: When speaking about their ideas or thoughts, INTPs have a tendency to get frustrated
            when others can't keep up with a topic and may dismiss the person they're talking to.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Logicians are exploratory people. They like to delve into a project and figure out how to overcome the
            obstacles that come with it. They can understand intricate and complex systems. </p>
        <p>Although they don't have bad people-skills, logicians may prefer less customer-oriented positions. They are
            innovative and like structure in their work. As they can recognise multiple opportunities and foresee
            problems, a career in a planning position such a corporate strategist would be well-suited to an INTP.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:5%;">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>As logicians quite like their time alone, they are quite selective about who they <i>do</i> spend their time
            with. They tend to become friends with people who share their love for new theories and riddles. They are
            not against having people challenge their ideas, however.</p>
