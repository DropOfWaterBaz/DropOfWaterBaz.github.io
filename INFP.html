          INFPs or Mediators are quiet but open-minded people. They are
          imaginative and creative. This creative energy is funnelled into their
          personal lives (as opposed to their social life). Mediators can
          sometimes feel lonely and as they tend not to have a large circle of
          friends, they look for deeper and more meaningful relationships.

        <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
      </h2>
      <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
      <p>
        - <u>Creativity</u>: INFPs are no stranger to letting their mind
        wander. This and their strong imagination allows them to look at
        problems from a unique perspective, they have great lateral-thinking
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Open-Mindedness</u>: Mediators are tolerant people. They don't look
        for fault in people and they tend to be accepting of other people's
        views. They hold themselves to a (often unrealistic) high standard and
        so are understanding when others make a mistake or who have done wrong
        in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Generosity</u>: INFPs are unselfish, and when something good works
        out for them, they are happy to share the happiness. However, this is a
        double-edged sword as it some people may take advantage of their selflessness.
      </p>

      <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
      <p>
        - <u>Lack of Realism</u>: INFPs are idealistic, and so it is difficult
        for them to accept a world that is anything other than ideal. It can
        result in having a perception of reality through a "rose-tinted" lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Loneliness</u>: Mediators yearn for deep emotional connection.
        However, they can have a tough time finding the ability and words to
        connect to others, which can end up in them feeling alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <u>Self-Criticism</u>: Mediators may often be overly-critical of
        themselves. They struggle to live up to the idealistic expectations that
        they set for themselves, which has detrimental effect on their
        self-esteem.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 5%">
        <b>Careers</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mediators are artistic and free-flowing people. As they spend so much
        time in their inside world, they love self-expression. There is no
        perfect job, not something that the idealistic INFPs want to hear. They
        suit low-stress, low drama occupations that don't get too hectic.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these points in mind and INFPs like to work at their own pace, a
        career in some sort of writing - biographical, poetic or even a prose
        narrative.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 5%">
        <b>Relationships</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mediators often find themselves in the following predicament - they love
        their time by themselves but can feel lonely when they get it. They want
        to be well-liked, but often worry about putting their true selves out
        their. They also don't want to pretend to be someone else in order to be
        well-liked. For this reason, they flourish in the company of close,
        meaningful relationships.
      </p>
