                ISTJs or Logisticians (not to be confused with the Logician
                personality) have a rational perspective on reality. They are very
                deliberate in their actions and waste no time on the task at hand.
                Logisticians are not the type to leave work to the last minute, and
                will become irritable if they do so. They use facts and clear
                information to come to their conclusions and to make their
                decisions. They trust their self-reliance more than that of others.

            <b>Strengths vs. Weaknesses</b>
        </h2>
        <u><b>Strengths</b></u>
        <p>
            - <u>Responsibility</u>: Logisticians are reliable people and stick to their
            word. They do what needs to be done and don't laze around. They would
            rather work to the point of self-exhaustion than fail to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <u>All-rounders</u>: ISTJs have a great capacity to retain information on a
            wide range of topics. Coupled with their ability to pick things up
            quickly, they are able to be of use in almost all situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <u>Attention to Detail</u>: If a logistician has to do something, they make
            sure they get it done right. They don't cut corners and can be relied
            on to perfect each facet of what they do to the best of their ability.
        </p>

        <u><b>Weaknesses</b></u>
        <p>
            - <u>Obedience to Rules</u>: Though there is nothing wrong with being
            respectful of rules, ISTJs may take this too far. They refuse to do
            anything that could even be <i>perceived</i> as breaking the rules.
            This can result in a lack of innovation and originality.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <u>Judgemental</u>: As logisticians see the world mostly through rationale,
            they can be quick to dismiss those with opposite opinions to them.
            This stubbornness can make them close-minded and have a lack of
            respect for those with different perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <u>Insensitivity</u>: As they communicate via facts and information, ISTJs
            can often miss the chance to be tactful with their words. They don't
            always consider the feelings of others when they say something, which
            can upset their loved ones or cause conflict to arise.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 5%">
            <b>Careers</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Logisticians seek professional stability, they tend to lean away from
            freelance or consultancy work. Traditionalists themselves, many ISTJs
            find themselves winding up in long-established institutions such as
            law enforcement, the military and other roles in which they feel they
            can contribute to society as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, these are not the only desires of ISTJs in their career.
            They like to work in a position that they can use their knowledge and
            there isn't too may abstract aspects of the job - such roles may be as
            an accountant, in administration or data analysts.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 5%">
            <b>Relationships</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Logisticians are not the type to plan a random adventure with their
            social circle. Not to say they aren't fun, but they like to know in
            advance if there are any events upcoming and don't tend to do things
            on a whim. They can be slow to make friends, treading carefully, but
            this means that those that they do form relationships with have their
            loyalty and trust. They aren't the most emotionally formidable, but
            they express themselves through what they do and not what they say. They
            enjoy the company of extraverts as they can fill most of the
            conversation and the burden to make chat isn't on them. They don't
            like getting into conflict and this is a reason that many people they
            surround themselves with have similar principles and opinions.
        </p>
